============
Requirements
============

The following programs and libraries must be installed to build the evlio libraries:

* Python 2.4 or higher (2.7 recommended)
* `cmake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_
* cfitsio (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)

.. note::
    In case cmake is causing problems (i.e. it might not be widely
    installed) we should switch to automake for simplicity.
